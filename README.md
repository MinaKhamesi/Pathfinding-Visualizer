This application visualizes five different pathfinding algorithms and five maze generation algorithms. You can visualize one algorithm at a time or you can visualize multiple algorithms at the same time. Up to four grid will be available and in each grid you can have a maze generation algorithm and a pathfinding algorithm assigned to it.
